## Microcart!!!!

Do you remember your time at an outlet mall? How cool it was to be apart of that as a shop? You don't? That's ok, because you can be a part of the online outlet market
with Microcart. Microcart is an easy to use shop interface, kinda like shopify, but easier for everyone. It's small, some would say micro small, and easy
to integrate into already made websites. Don't have a website? That's ok! We'll make you a single page market that has you products, shop information, details, and shop logo,
contact information, and cart ALL in one spot so you don't have to. 

I know. Your thinking what's the subscription gonna cost to use this market? What if we told you it's completely free of use. The only thing it'll cost you is 2% per transaction plus the gateway fees. But until then, you can test it, create a shop, ALL FOR FREE! Themes you ask?! YES INDEED! Grab one of the few themes from the page
and enjoy free and easy style bars to quickly manage the style. Want additional themes? We will offer a premium cart interface that'll allow u to either purchase a 
theme once for use or, wait for it, a cheap subscription to get all the themes added and additional themes as they come about.

Not only is it incredibly easy to setup, manage, and maintain, but it's also all linked to the microcart market meaning your users can create a single interface and shop anywhere. Also, you get to meet people in the market, join a place that'll get you more views, and have more "foot traffic" to the shop. 

It's as simple as entering the wizard and filling out a couple forms. What are you waiting for?! Join the market now!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
